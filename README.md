Repo to learn and practice Tailwind

## My conclusion on trying out the TailwindCSS:
I would not recommend introducing Tailwind in a commercial project as it is not efficient effort/outcome wise.

### Cons:
- all css rules have classes for them, those classes need to be memorized as syntacsis is critical and not always intuitive. This slows down development, esp. at the beginning of working with Tailwind
- html elements that need a lot of styling applied, acquire a large number of classes (with not very readable names), this makes html hard to read and edit
- styling every element separately is very inefficient since when changes to styling are needed, they need to be made for every element separately
